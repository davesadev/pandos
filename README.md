# PANDOS

is a fullstack web app that expidites the workflow of structural bioinformatics researchersâ€™  by combining information from many protein databases into a new and easily searchable database.  

The application's frontend is [deployed](http://titin.abrol.csun.edu/pandos/) on an apache server, while the backend and database are deployed on Azure.

## What is the problem?

The currently available information on membrane protein domains is scattered over different platforms and is mainly focussed towards the transmembrane (TM) domains. In order to compare the same domain between proteins or to compare different domains within a protein, a standard is needed.


## The solution:

A web-based searchable database containing membrane fasta (mfta) files enriched with topological features. All one needs to do is enter a protein's Uniprot ID or a protein complex's PDB ID and the app outputs all of the consensus protein chain information associated with the protein ID.
